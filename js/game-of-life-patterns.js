(The concept of computability can be defined in terms\n of Turing machines, or by Church's lambda calculus, or by a number\n of other methods, all of which can be shown to lead to equivalent\n definitions.) The relevance of this to Life is that both Bill\n Gosper and John Conway proved early on that it is possible to\n construct a universal computer in the Life universe. (To prove\n the universality of a {cellular automaton} with simple rules was\n in fact Conway's aim in Life right from the start.) Conway's proof\n is outlined in {Winning Ways}, and also in {The Recursive Universe}.\n Until recently, no universal Life computer had ever been built in\n practice, because it would be enormous, even with the improvements\n that have been devised since those early proofs. In April 2000,\n Paul Rendell completed a Turing machine construction (described\n in {http:\/\/www.cs.ualberta.ca\/~bulitko\/F02\/papers\/tm_words.pdf}).\n This, however, has a finite tape, as opposed to the infinite tape of\n a true Turing machine, and is therefore not a universal computer.\n But in November 2002, Paul Chapman announced the construction\n of a universal computer, details of which can be found at\n {http:\/\/www.igblan.free-online.co.uk\/igblan\/ca\/}. This is\n a universal register machine based around Dean Hickerson's\n {sliding block memory}.\n See also {universal constructor}.","definition":null},"universal constructor":{"type":null,"description":"A pattern that is capable of constructing\n almost any pattern that has a {glider synthesis}. This definition is\n a bit vague. A precise definition seems impossible because it has\n not been proved that all possible glider fleets are constructible.\n In any case, a universal constructor ought to be able to construct\n itself in order to qualify as such. An outline of Conway's proof\n that such a pattern exists can be found in {Winning Ways}, and also\n in {The Recursive Universe}. The key mechanism for the production\n of gliders with any given path and timing is known as side-tracking,\n and is based on the {kickback reaction}. A universal constructor\n designed in this way can also function as a universal destructor\n - it can delete almost any pattern that can be deleted by gliders.\n In May 2004, Paul Chapman and Dave Greene produced a prototype\n programmable universal constructor. This is able to construct\n objects by means of {slow glider construction}s. It likely that\n it could be programmed to be construct itself, but the necessary\n program would be very large; moreover an additional mechanism would\n be needed in order to copy the program.\n A universal constructor is most useful when attached to a\n {universal computer}, which can be programmed to control the\n constructor to produce the desired pattern of gliders. In what\n follows I will assume that a universal constructor always includes\n this computer.\n The existence of a universal constructor\/destructor has a number of\n theoretical consequences.\n For example, the constructor could be programmed to make copies of\n itself. This is a {replicator}.\n The constructor could even be programmed to make just one copy\n of itself translated by a certain amount and then delete itself.\n This would be a (very large, very high period) {spaceship}. Any\n translation is possible (except that it must not be too small), so\n that the spaceship could travel in any direction. It could also\n travel slower than any given speed, since we could program it to\n perform some time-wasting task (such as repeatedly constructing and\n deleting a block) before copying itself. Of course, we could also\n choose for it to leave some debris behind, thus making a {puffer}.\n It is also possible to show that the existence of a universal\n constructor implies the existence of a {stable} {reflector}. This\n proof is not so easy, however, and is no longer of much significance\n now that explicit examples of such reflectors are known.","definition":null},"universal destructor":{"type":null,"description":"See {universal constructor}.","definition":null},"universal register machine":{"type":null,"description":"= {URM}","definition":null},"universal regulator":{"type":null,"description":"A {regulator} in which the incoming gliders are\n aligned to period 1, that is, they have arbitrary timing (subject\n to some minimum time required for the regulator to recover from the\n previous glider).\n Paul Chapman constructed the first universal regulator in March\n 2003.
